### Hystory of vision
543 million years ago, its the beginign of the vision
Evolution's big bang -> the firsts animals developed eyes (Andrew Parker)

Biggest sensor system of intelligent animals **50% of our [neurons](math/IA/neurons.md) are in the vision interpretation area**
 
Hubel & wiesel 50s/60s 
    - electrofisiology 
    - visual porcesing mechanism in animals (cat brain)
Summer vision project MIT

How does we procces the images?
Simplifying it
- In stanford ~73/79
        Was proposed that the objets are a collection of fundamental perfect geometric shapes
            - Generalized cilinder (cilinders)
            - pictorial structure (graph tree alike)
- David Lowe
    - Reconstruction of lines
Object recognition was a difficult task, so, instead we started to use object segmentation to do progress in the [computer vision](math/IA/computer-vision.md)


A common problem is the Overfitting
    Images are very complex, the model requires many parameters and layers, so when we don't haver enough data the models tend to overfitt very commonly

The image classification challenge
The error graphs were very high ~ 30% in 2010 and 2011, but in 2012 we made a close in the gap with 16% in error, this year, AlexNet, a similar GPU-based CNN by Alex Krizhevsky et al. won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012.[70] It was an early catalytic event for the AI boom. 


Convolutional neural networks exist since the 80's, but in the 2012 they became popular, this is because some of the next reasons:
    - Increment in [CPU](04_Systems_Software/CPU.md) and [GPU](04_Systems_Software/gpu.md) power (Moore's Law)
    - GPU-based paralelization
        - Larger architectures
    - Increment in labeled data

# Objective of computer-vision
Interpret the history behind the image, have data and coul do interpretations far away from pure [clasification](math/IA/clasificacin.md)
