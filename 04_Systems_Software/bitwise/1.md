# [Sets](04_Systems_Software/bitwise/sets.md)
In programming we could divide the sets in:
    - Unordered sets
        Hash functions
            $O(1)$
            $O(log(n))$ - > $O(log_2(n))$
            **Fastest**
    - Ordered sets 
        Could order the numbers with a graph tree
        $O(log_2(n))$
